        Summary
        Follow the winding path with numbers 1, 2 and 3

        Description
        1. The goal is to start at the entrance in the top left corner and proceed
           towards the center, leaving a trail of numbers.
        2. The numbers must be entered in the sequence 1,2,3 1,2,3 1,2,3 etc,
           however not every tile must be filled in and some tiles will remain
           empty.
        3. Your task is to determine which tiles will be empty, following these
           two rules:
        4. Trail Rule: The first number to write after entering in the top left
           is a 1 and the last before ending in the center is a 3. In between,
           the 1,2,3 sequence will repeat many times in this order, following the
           snail path.
        5. Board Rule: Each row and column of the board (disregarding the snail
           path) must have exactly one 1, one 2 and one 3.
