1. Try to drive around the circuit without hitting the road blocks: draw a single closed non-intersecting loop.
2. The arrows and numbers tell you the total number of cells borders the road crosses in that direction.
3. In the example, looking at the top stretch, the road goes through 4 cells, hence it crosses 3 cell borders.
4. Also on the top left, the road goes through 2 cells and so it crosses one cell border.
5. Black cells must be inside the loop. White cells must be outside the loop.
6. The number tells you the total tiles crossed in that direction. So that could be split in two stretches or more.
